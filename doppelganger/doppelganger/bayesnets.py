"""Library for modeling generative typed bayesian networks.

Each model consists of multiple networks, one for each type of input data.
For instance, a person model might have a different network for persons of
each household type. This allows the model to learn transition probabilities
for data of each type.

`SegmentedData` helps train this typed network structure by allowing users to
specify a segmentation function to segment the training data by type.
